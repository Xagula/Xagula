I know basics of python, know how to use html and css and i will be honest I have solid knowladge in both and if i miss something in any of them I know where to find that information! I started learning solidity bcs i want to become blockchain developer I am very motivated watched some tutorials on youtube and i will be happy if someone hires me as junior developer and teach me new skills so i will do some work for them. I am very motivated, I know I should done it earlier to start educating myself and I am regreting the seconds I lost in gaming, yes i am gamer well i wasted to much time on gaming and got nothing from them kinda i was addicted to pleasure and fun now i had left behind that harmfull behavior and got back on track. I have some and even solid experience in different fields especially in science also i can call myself kinda educated one just it neds to be updated.
